Privacy Policy
Effective Date: June 01, 2025

Trading Tracker helps you monitor and analyze your investment activities securely and privately. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

This Privacy Policy describes how IngeniWare Solutions ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your personal information when you use our mobile application, Trading Tracker (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information responsibly.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.

1. Information We Collect
We collect various types of information in connection with the App for the purposes outlined in this policy.

a. Information You Directly Provide to Us:  When you use the App, you may manually enter or provide us with personal information, including:

Transaction Data:  Details of your financial transactions, such as dates, amounts, categories, descriptions, investment names, quantities, purchase/sale prices, and other related financial notes you choose to input.
Account Information:  If you create an account directly with us (e.g., for cloud backup if offered), this may include your email address and a password.
Communications:  Any information you provide when you contact us for support, feedback, or inquiries.
b. Information Collected from Third-Party Services (with your explicit authorization):  The App allows you to connect to and import data from third-party services, such as Google Sheets or financial APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). When you authorize such connections:

Google Sheets:  We access only the specific Google Sheet(s) you designate for reading and/or writing financial data to enable the App's tracking functionality. We do not access other files or data in your Google Drive.
Financial APIs:  We may access data such as transaction history, account balances, and investment holdings from financial institutions or data providers you connect to. We do not store or have access to your login credentials for third-party services; authentication is handled securely by the respective service providers.
The specific data accessed from these third-party services will depend on the permissions you grant and the functionality of the App. We will only access data necessary to provide the tracking and analysis features of the App.
c. Automatically Collected Information:  When you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and your usage of the App, including:

Device Information:  Such as your mobile device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
Log Data:  Information about how you interact with the App, including access times, features used, crashes, and other system activity. This data is primarily used for troubleshooting and improving App performance.
Usage Data:  Aggregated and anonymized data about how features are used to help us understand user behavior and improve the App. This typically does not identify you personally.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide and Maintain the App:  To operate, deliver, and maintain the functionality of the Trading Tracker App, including processing your user-entered data and integrating with authorized third-party services.
For Personal Financial Tracking:  To enable you to record, organize, analyze, and visualize your financial transactions and investment activities within the App.
To Improve and Develop the App:  To understand usage trends, diagnose technical problems, and develop new features or improve existing ones. This often involves the use of aggregated and anonymized data.
To Communicate with You:  To send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.
To Ensure Security:  To protect the security and integrity of the App, prevent fraud, and enforce our Terms of Service.
To Comply with Legal Obligations:  To meet legal and regulatory requirements, including responding to lawful requests from public authorities.
We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your personal financial data to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.  Your transaction data and investment details are used solely to provide the personal finance tracking services within the App. Aggregated and anonymized data is used solely for analytical purposes and cannot be linked back to any individual user.

3. How We Share Your Information
We may share your information in the following circumstances:

With Your Consent:  We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.
With Connected Third-Party Services (as authorized by you):  When you choose to connect the App to services like Google Sheets or financial APIs, you are authorizing us to share your data with, or retrieve data from, these services as necessary to enable the App's functionality. This is entirely at your discretion. We do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, and their respective privacy policies will apply to any data you share with them.
With Service Providers:  We may engage third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App (e.g., hosting providers, analytics services). Our service providers include hosting, analytics, and customer support companies, all of whom are contractually obligated to protect your information.
For Legal Reasons:  We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request). We may also disclose your information to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.
Business Transfers:  In the event that IngeniWare Solutions is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as a business asset. We will provide notice before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
Aggregated or Anonymized Data:  We may share aggregated or anonymized information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you, with third parties for various purposes, including business analysis, research, or service improvement.
4. Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the App services, fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. When your personal information is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it. If you delete your account, we will endeavor to delete your personal data from our systems within a reasonable timeframe, unless retention is required for legal or legitimate business purposes.

5. Data Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We regularly review our security practices and follow industry standards to protect your data.

6. Your Choices and Rights
You have certain rights regarding your personal information:

Access and Correction:  You have the right to access and update much of your personal information directly within the App. For information not accessible directly, you may contact us to request access or correction.
Deletion:  You may request the deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us. Please note that some data may be retained if legally required or necessary for legitimate business purposes.
Withdraw Consent:  Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Opt-out of Communications:  You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions in those messages.
Disabling Third-Party Connections:  You can disconnect your third-party service integrations (e.g., Google Sheets, financial APIs) within the App's settings at any time.

7. Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 18 without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

8. International Data Transfers
Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. IngeniWare Solutions is based in Canada. If our service providers are located outside of Canada, your data may be processed in those jurisdictions. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.

We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
