Welcome
Welcome to Trading Tracker! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile application ("App"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. Please read them carefully.

1. Use of the App
The App is intended solely for informational and personal finance tracking purposes. Specifically, it enables you to manually record, organize, and analyze your financial transactions and investment activities. The App does not facilitate real-time bidding, trading, or the execution of any financial market orders.  It is not a financial advisory or brokerage platform.

IngeniWare Solutions does not  provide investment, financial, legal, accounting, or tax advice, and nothing within the App should be construed as such. We are not a financial institution, broker-dealer, or registered investment advisor.

You are solely responsible for:

- The accuracy, completeness, and legality of the data you input into the App;

- Any financial decisions or actions you take based on the information presented by the App;

- Ensuring compliance with any applicable financial regulations or obligations in your jurisdiction.

- Ensuring that any activity occurring under your account is authorized and lawful, whether or not you performed the activity yourself.

You agree to notify IngeniWare Solutions immediately of any unauthorized access, use, or suspected breach of your account or any associated third-party accounts. IngeniWare Solutions is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

Your use of such third-party services is at your own risk and subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with.

8. Updates to the App and Services
We may, in our sole discretion, update, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the App or its features and functionality at any time without notice or liability.
